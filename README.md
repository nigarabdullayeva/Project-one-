# Project-one-Movic
As a team that loves cinematography, we decided to create a flexible application that allows users to find their favorite movies’ information and all movie soundtracks. To find your interested content it is enough to type a movie name and press search button.  Application will render with the movie data and the list of soundtracks from YouTube channel. Users will be able to play a list of soundtracks by clicking “play” in the video. Enjoy your favorite soundtracks with MoVic application. 

Criterias that our team followed:
* Must use at least two server-side APIs
* Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap
* Use at least one new third-party API
* Must have a polished, mobile-ﬁrst UI
* Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.)
* Does NOT use alerts, conﬁrms, or prompts (look into modals).
* Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)
* Must be deployed to GitHub Pages
